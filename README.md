# SNIaArchiveBlueBump
The goal of this project is to search through the Open Supernovae Catalog to look for SN Ia that displayed a "blue bump", a possible signal for the single degenerate formation mechanism. It was started and primarily developed by B Santos in Spring 2022, and is now maintained by Christopher Duston (christopher.duston@protonmail.com).

The main Jupyter Notebook is Astronomy.ipynb. The source of the data is the Open Supernovae Catalog ( https://sne.space/ )...but note that as of this time (Summer 2022), that catalog is not being updated any longer. Part of what is included here is a snapshot of that dataset, which should be very close to the last available. The API is still functional, and this code should still work fine going forwards.

The science goal here was to look for evidence of "the blue bump" in SN Ia data.

(At some point, there will be a link here to a more careful description of the science goals of this project.)
